# Conversation between me and the newly employed marketing team lead
Him: What user type do we have and what's the ratio amongst them?

Me: Look below. We have two types of users, namely:

1. Customers

2. Subscribers

And the ratio of the customer to subscriber is approximately, 1:8.

## Conversation between me and the newly employed marketing team lead - Contd.
Him: I am aware that our company's profit is dependent on rental duration. How does each user type contribute to that?

Me: From the visual below, on average a customer's rental duration is more than twice that of a subscriber

Him: Wow, that's a whole lot translating into profits. Imagine the numbers we can reach if we can turn more subscribers into customers. I think I foresee a marketing campaign once the survey is concluded.
